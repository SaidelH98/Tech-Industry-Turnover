# Tech-Industry-Turnover
Final project for COGS 108

Our project analyzes the reason why large companies in the tech industry experience one of the highest turnover rates in the business world. In this project, comb through and analyze a dataset in order to determine whether factors like work environment or compensation may be a reason to leave 'dream jobs' at these companies. The analysis starts by looking at the numerical ratings given to these companies and later moves on to the most significant part of the analysis: the text reviews left by current or former employees of these tech companies.
